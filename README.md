# DJ-Interface-for-RPI

This application is designed specifically for a Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" display. 
It is a music playback, analysis, and mixing application for .wav audio files, inspired by DJ software such as Serato DJ and Rekordbox. 
The application also includes drivers for MIDI controllers, allowing external hardware control. 
The user interface and audio analysis are implemented in Python, while the audio processing engine is planned to be developed in C++ (coming soon).
